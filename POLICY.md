## Disclosure policy

I dedicated to working closely with the open source community and with projects that are affected by a vulnerability, in order to protect users and ensure a coordinated disclosure. When I identify a vulnerability in a project, I will report with the process that the **huntr.dev** goes through in order to be eligible for bounties, then they _("the huntr team")_ contacting the publicly-listed security contact for the project if one exists; otherwise they will suggest security policy and/or attempt to contact the project maintainers directly.

If the project team responds and agrees the issue poses a security risk, we _("me & the huntr team")_ will work with the project security team or maintainers to communicate the vulnerability in detail, and agree on the process for public disclosure.

So I did coordinated disclosure by stand and/or follow the guidelines & [policy of the huntr](https://huntr.dev/policy/) platform.

My disclosure deadline for publicly disclosing a vulnerability is: [**120-days**](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/advisory/blob/master/.github/workflows/deadline.yaml#L21) after the first report _(through huntr)_ to the project team.

I appreciate the hard work maintainers put into fixing vulnerabilities and understand that sometimes more time is required to properly address an issue.
